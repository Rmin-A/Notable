# README

Notable, an Evernote clone, is a single page application which was developed over a span of 10 days with Ruby on Rails, React, Redux and PostgreSQL. Notable allows users to safely create an account, create notes and organize with Notebooks and Tags.
Although users are not allowed to assign more than one notebook for each note, they are able to have several different tags for one note and on the other hand a simple tag can belong to different notes which make organizing super simple and very user friendly.
